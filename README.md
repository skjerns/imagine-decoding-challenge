The Epochs have been scrambled! Can you figure out in which epoch we played which auditory stimulus?


### Description

We've shown ten different visual stimulus items to our participant (see [Kern et al 2024](https://elifesciences.org/articles/93357)) in a localizer (called LOCALIZER trials). Each of the items was associated with the word that describes the item. At the end of our experiment we asked them to close their eyes and imagine the stimulus item as vividly as possible whenenever we played the spoken word auditorily to them (called IMAGINE trials).

However, the IMAGINE epochs are now scrambled and we don't know anymore in word was played in which trial!

Can you help us realign the items?
